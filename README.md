Great Expectations Tutorial


1. Create a Data Context
```bash
great_expectations init
```
Your Data Context will contain the entirety of your Great Expectations project. It is also the entry point for accessing all of the primary methods for creating elements of your project, configuring those elements, and working with the metadata for your project. That is why the first thing you do when working with Great Expectations is to initialize a Data Context!


2. Create a Datasource with the CLI
```bash
great_expectations datasource new
```
